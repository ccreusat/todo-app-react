## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I used

- SortableJS is a really great JS to simplify the use of the drag&drop, sortable elements.
- I made a function object useLocalStorage (kinda inspired by the custom hook in React)
- I wrote 3 version of my JS. I write it straight and then made in as a "plugin" and I decided, finally, to use the V2.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Sortable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable) - This helped me for the drap and drop reorder.
